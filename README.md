# fujicli

A CLI to manage Fujifilm devices, simulations, backups, and rendering.

## Status

This tool has only been tested with the **Fujifilm X-T5**, as it is the sole camera I own. While the underlying PTP commands may be compatible with other models, **compatibility is not guaranteed**.

**Use this software at your own risk.** I am not responsible for any damage, loss of data, or other adverse outcomes - physical or psychological - to your camera or equipment resulting from the use of this program.

This project is currently under heavy development. Contributions are welcome. If you own a different Fujifilm camera, testing and reporting compatibility is highly appreciated.
